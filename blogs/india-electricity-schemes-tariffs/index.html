                <div class="article-content">
                    <h2>Introduction: More Than Just 'Units Consumed'</h2>
                    
                    <p>Your electricity bill is more than just a number. It's a complex document reflecting state policies, national schemes, and intricate tariff structures. For most Indians, terms like "Fixed Charges," "Wheeling Charge," "Electricity Duty," and "Tariff Slabs" are confusing. Yet, understanding them is the key to unlocking significant savings and making the most of government benefits.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2025, as India continues its energy transition, the landscape of electricity pricing and subsidies is constantly evolving. State governments are rolling out new relief measures, while the central government is pushing for renewable energy adoption. This guide will serve as your single source of truth, demystifying the Indian electricity sector from a consumer's perspective.</p>

                    <h2>Decoding Electricity Tariffs: Why Your Neighbour Pays a Different Rate</h2>
                    
                    <p>Electricity is a state-governed subject in India. This means the price you pay per unit (kWh) is decided by your State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). It varies wildly across the country. For instance, as of early 2025, residential tariffs in some parts of Maharashtra are among the highest, while Delhi enjoys comparatively lower rates, partly due to heavy subsidies.</p>

                    <h3>The Slab System Explained: Telescopic vs. Non-Telescopic</h3>
                    
                    <p>Most states use a slab-based tariff system for residential consumers. The more you consume, the higher your rate per unit. There are two main types:</p>
                    
                    <div class="tariff-types">
                        <div class="tariff-type">
                            <h4>üîÑ Telescopic Tariff (Pro-Consumer)</h4>
                            <p>You pay for the units in each slab at that slab's rate. This is the most common and fair system.</p>
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example (Delhi):</strong> If you use 250 units, the first 200 are charged at the lower rate, and the remaining 50 at the next slab's rate.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="tariff-type">
                            <h4>üìà Non-Telescopic Tariff (Expensive)</h4>
                            <p>If your consumption crosses a certain threshold, the highest rate is applied to all the units you've consumed.</p>
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example (MSEDCL - Maharashtra):</strong> If the slabs are 0-100 and 101-300, and you consume 101 units, the rate for the 101-300 slab applies to all 101 units, not just the extra one.
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                        In a 'telescopic' tariff (common in states like Delhi), each slab is charged at its respective rate. In a 'non-telescopic' tariff (like in parts of Maharashtra), if your consumption crosses a certain slab, the highest slab rate is applied to all units consumed, making it much more expensive.

                                        Subsidy eligibility depends on your state of residence and your consumption level. Many states offer automatic subsidies for low-consumption domestic users (e.g., consuming less than 100 or 200 units). Check your state's DISCOM (Distribution Company) website for the latest eligibility criteria.

                                        Fixed charges are a monthly fee levied by the DISCOM based on the sanctioned load of your connection (measured in kilowatts, kW). This charge is for maintaining the electricity grid infrastructure and is payable even if your consumption is zero.
